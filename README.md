# Colourful-Digital-Clock-That-Changes-Colours-Dynamically.

I've created a colourful digital clock with the following features:

1. **Real-time Display**: Shows the current time and date with updates every second.

2. **Dynamic Colours**: The clock changes colours automatically, cycling through a vibrant palette.

3. **Animated Background**: Colourful floating particles create a lively backdrop for the clock.

4. **Multiple Display Options**:
   - Toggle between 12-hour and 24-hour formats
   - Option to show or hide seconds

5. **Responsive Design**: The clock will look good on various screen sizes.

The clock's design elements include:
- A sleek, dark background with a glass-like clock face
- Smooth colour transitions that change with the seconds
- Colourful floating particles that randomly update
- Easy-to-read font with a subtle glow effect
- Simple control buttons for customizing the display

The JavaScript handles all time calculations and updates the display in real-time, while also managing the colour changes and particle animations.
